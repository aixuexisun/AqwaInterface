Aqwa is a commercial software package developed by Ansys for the design and analysis of marine systems. When the AqwaInterface module
is used in [FAST v8] (https://nwtc.nrel.gov/FAST8 "FAST8"), all hydrodynamic and mooring loads will be computed using Aqwa, while the turbine,
tower, and floating platform structural dynamics; aerodynamics; and control and electrical-drive dynamics will be computed by FAST.

For more information, please refer to documentation on the [Aqwa Interface web site] (https://nwtc.nrel.gov/AqwaInterface "AqwaInterface").
